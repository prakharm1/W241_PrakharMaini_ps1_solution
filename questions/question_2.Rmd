# Potential Outcomes and Treatment Effects 

```{r, include = TRUE}
table <- data.table(
  subject = 1:7, 
  y_0 = c(10, 12, 15, 11, 10, 17, 16), 
  y_1 = c(12, 12, 18, 14, 15, 18, 16),
  tau = c(2, 0, 3, 3, 5, 1, 0)
)
```

1. Use the values in the table below to illustrate that $E[Y_i(1)]-E[Y_i(0)] = E[Y_i(1)- [Y_i(0)]$.
2. Is it possible to collect all necessary values and construct a table like the one below in real life? Explain why or why not.
